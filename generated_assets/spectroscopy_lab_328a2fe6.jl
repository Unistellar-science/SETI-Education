# 🌈 Spectroscopy Lab

This notebook provides a short methods introduction to the field of [spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy) in astronomy. As a companion to the *[RSpec Unistellar Manual](https://www.rspec-astro.com/download/Unistellar%20Spectra.pdf)*, we will walk through some of the techniques behind the core concepts used there to produce and analyze astronomical spectra. Over the course of the notebook, we will introduce and use interactive tools and hands-on live code examples to investigate the following concepts:

* Image processing
* Array/matrix operations
* Wavelength calibration

Having some familiarity in high-level programming languages like Julia or Python will be useful, but not necessary, for following along with the topics covered. At the end of this notebook, you will hopefully have the tools to build your own analysis pipelines for processing astronomical data, as well as understand the principles behind other astronomical software at a broader level.

!!! note "Coffee? ☕"
	The first time this notebook runs might take a while (~ a couple minutes on older devices) because it will download and set up everything for us. This is a good chance to take a stretch or grab a nice beverage 🫖.

!!! note "First time running"
	Some parts of this [Pluto notebook](https://plutojl.org/) are partially interactive online, but for full interactive control, it is recommended to download and run this notebook locally. For instructions on how to do this, click the `Edit or run this notebook` button in the top right corner of the page.
	
	**Note**: This notebook will download all of the analysis packages and data needed for us, so the first time it runs may take a little while (~ a few minutes depending on your internet connection and platform). Clicking on the `Status` tab in the bottom right will bring up a progress window that we can use to monitor this process, and it also includes an option at the bottom marked `Notify when done` that can be selected to give us a notification pop-up in our browser when everything is finished.

!!! tip "Advanced: bring your own editor"
	This is a fully hackable notebook, so exploring the [source code](https://github.com/Unistellar-science/SETI-Education/blob/main/labs/occulations/occultations_lab.jl) and making your own modifications is encouraged! Unlike Jupyter notebooks, Pluto notebook are just plain Julia files. Any changes you make in the notebook are automatically saved to the source file.

	This works in the opposite direction too; any changes you make to the source file, say in your favorite editor, will automatically be reflected in the notebook in your browser! To enable this feature, just add this keyword to the function that was used to start Pluto:

	```julia-repl
	julia> using Pluto
	
	julia> Pluto.run(auto_reload_from_file=true)
	
	# This will be on by default in an upcoming release =]
	```

	The location of the file for this notebook is displayed in the bar at the very top of this page, and can also be modified there if you want to change where this notebook lives.


!!! warning "Diving deeper"
	Periodically throughout the notebook we will include collapsible sections like the one below to provide additional information about items outside the scope of this lab that may be of interest (e.g., plotting, working with javascript, creating widgets).

	In the local version of this notebook, an "eye" icon will appear at the top left of each cell on hover to reveal the underlying code behind it and a `Live Docs` button will also be available in the bottom right of the page to pull up documentation for any function that is currently selected. In both local and online versions of this notebook, user defined functions and variables are also underlined, and (ctrl) clicking on them will jump to where they are defined.

## Image processing

Astronomical spectra start their lives as a picture. These images can come in a variety of different formats, the most popular being the [Flexible Image Transport System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS) (FITS) format. We will explore this later in the notebook, but let's start with another common format that you probably use everyday, [Portable Network Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG) (PNG), to get an idea of how image data is represented.

Even though this part is Julia specific, the underlying information is general enough to apply to most image processing libraries. Let's break down what each piece means: 

* [`ColorTypes`](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/ColorTypes.jl): The name of the package where a type called `RGB` is defined.

* [`RGB`](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/ColorTypes.jl#rgb-plus-bgr-xrgb-rgbx-and-rgb24-the-abstractrgb-group): A type that stores the red, green, and blue intensity values of a pixel. These can be thought of as [sub-pixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel#Subpixels)

* [`FixedPointNumbers`](https://github.com/JuliaMath/FixedPointNumbers.jl): The name of the package where a type called `N0f8` is defined.

* [`N0f8`](https://github.com/JuliaMath/FixedPointNumbers.jl#type-hierarchy-and-interpretation): A type that represents a number in memory. This essentially defines the specific number type used for each red, green, and blue value in each pixel.

The converversion process from ``RGB`` to Grayscale for a given pixel is achieved by taking a weighted average of its channel values according to an [international standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luma_%28video%29#Rec._601_luma_versus_Rec._709_luma_coefficients) established to emulate how the [human eye perceives relative brightnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale#Converting_color_to_grayscale):

```math
0.299 R + 0.587 G + 0.114 B \quad.

Now that we are able to access the underlying structure of our data, let's explore next how we can extract subsets that we might be interested in. One common approach, known as [array slicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_slicing), accomplishes this by selecting the subset of pixels that fall within a specified rectangle.

Try using the sliders below to specify a region of interest where we would like to build a spectrum from. *Note that this will only work in the locally downladed version of this notebook.*

To build a spectrum of this selection across a given direction, we next perform a summation in the perpendicular direction. Synonymous terms for this are "dimension" and "axis". For example, if we wanted a spectrum in the "horizontal direction", we would sum up all the pixels in a given column. We call this final sum for a given column the intensity.

Many libraries have this operation built in, typically with a `dims` or `axis` keyword to specify the direction to sum in, as shown below:

To match the convention that we have adopted for displaying images (origin in top-left corner, x increasing downwards, y increasing rightwards), we use the [`permutedims`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/arrays/#Base.permutedims) function to swap the row and column order.

	We see some immediate qualitative similarities and differences from our dog spectrum. The dips in our 1D spectrum line up with the dimmer regions in the image, just like the "dog" features noted earlier. Zooming in on the image though, we see a cross-hatching pattern emerge. This is an artifact of the Bayer filter used by our sensor, and it manifests as a "sawtooth" pattern in our 1D specrtrum.
	
	As discussed in the "Debayering" section of the *[RSpec Unistellar Manual](https://www.rspec-astro.com/download/Unistellar%20Spectra.pdf)*, this imaging artifact can be reduced by either binning our data beforehand or applying a debayering algorithm as part of a stacking routine when combining our FITS images.

## Wavelength calibration

In this final process, we will use information about spectral features from a known reference to determine the general relationship between the pixel coordinate ``(\mathrm{px})`` on our sensor, and the wavelength of light falling upon it ``(\lambda)``. One common approach is to assume a linear relationship between these two spaces. In other words:

```math
\lambda - \lambda_0= d \times (\mathrm{px} - \mathrm{px}_0)\ ,
```

where ``(d)`` is the dispersion in wavelength per pixel and ``(\mathrm{px}_0)`` is the pixel coordinate corresponding to where we would like the wavelength ``(\lambda_0)`` to be zero (this allows us to have a relation of the form ``λ = \dots``). Using the location of the zeroth order light is typically a good choice for this. To determine ``d`` we select one other feature in our reference spectrum with known wavelength.

For example, let's use our image of Castor from earlier since it (well, technically the three brightest stars in this sextuple system that all resolve into a single point) is an A-type star. These types of stars are wonderful calibration sources because they tend to have prominent [Balmer series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmer_series) lines from hydrogen absorption in their atmopsheres. Identifying the (pixel, wavelength) pair ``(\mathrm{px}_\mathrm{line}, \lambda_\mathrm{line})``, we have:

```math
\newcommand{\wavline}{\lambda_\mathrm{line}}
\newcommand{\pxline}{\mathrm{px}_\mathrm{line}}
\newcommand{\pxzero}{\mathrm{px}_0}

\begin{align*}
d &= \frac{\wavline - 0.0}{\pxline - \pxzero} = \frac{\wavline}{\pxline - \pxzero} \\
\lambda &= \boxed{d \times (\mathrm{px} - \pxzero)}\ ,

!!! note "Web aside"
	The website we are pulling images from provides an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) to interact with its data. We use the stdlib [`Downloads.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Downloads.jl) to call this API, [`JSON.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaIO/JSON.jl) to parse the data that we downloaded, and [`Images.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaImages/Images.jl) to load it into Julia. This is essentially the same as doing the following on a local PNG file:
	```julia
	using Images
	img = load(LOCAL PATH TO MY FILE)
	```

	In this case, the path is just the url of the hosted image online provided by the API.

!!! note "Why vec?"
	Array operations in Julia preserve dimensionality to make things [more consistent and composable](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42353230/16402912). For example,

	```julia
	sum([
		1 2
		3 4
	]; dims=1)
	```

	returns another matrix

	```julia
	1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
	 4  6
	```

	instead of silently changing the shape out from under us to a 1D vector

	```julia
	[4, 6]
	```

	The flipside is that the [plotting library we are using](https://plotly.com/) expects a simple vector, so we call [`vec`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/arrays/#Base.vec) on the original sum to make this transformation for us before passing it to Plotly.

!!! note "What does |> do?"
	Known as the [pipe operator](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/#Function-composition-and-piping), this is a convenient way to pass the output of one function as input to another. For example,

	```julia
	sqrt(sum([1, 4, 5, 6])) # 4.0
	```

	is equivalent to:

	```julia
	[1, 4, 5, 6] |> sum |> sqrt # 4.0
