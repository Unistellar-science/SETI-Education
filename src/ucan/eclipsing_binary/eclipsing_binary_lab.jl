# ⚪ ⚫ Eclipsing Binary Lab
In this lab we will observe an eclipsing binary in real time and explore how to produce a light curve for it.

Having some familiarity in high-level programming languages like Julia or Python will be useful, but not necessary, for following along with the topics covered. At the end of this notebook, you will hopefully have the tools to build your own analysis pipelines for processing astronomical data, as well as understand the principles behind other astronomical software at a broader level.

!!! note "First time running"
	Some parts of this [Pluto notebook](https://plutojl.org/) are partially interactive online, but for full interactive control, it is recommended to download and run this notebook locally. For instructions on how to do this, click the `Edit or run this notebook` button in the top right corner of the page.
	
	**Note**: This notebook will download all of the analysis packages and data needed for us, so the first time it runs may take a little while (~ a few minutes depending on your internet connection and platform). Clicking on the `Status` tab in the bottom right will bring up a progress window that we can use to monitor this process, and it also includes an option at the bottom marked `Notify when done` that can be selected to give us a notification pop-up in our browser when everything is finished.

!!! tip "Advanced: bring your own editor"
	This is a fully hackable notebook, so exploring the [source code](https://github.com/Unistellar-science/SETI-Education/blob/main/labs/eclipsing_binary/eclipsing_binary_lab.jl) and making your own modifications is encouraged! Unlike Jupyter notebooks, Pluto notebook are just plain Julia files. Any changes you make in the notebook are automatically saved to the source file.

	This works in the opposite direction too; any changes you make to the source file, say in your favorite editor, will automatically be reflected in the notebook in your browser! To enable this feature, just add this keyword to the function that was used to start Pluto:

	```julia-repl
	julia> using Pluto
	
	julia> Pluto.run(auto_reload_from_file=true)
	
	# This will be on by default in an upcoming release =]
	```

	The location of the file for this notebook is displayed in the bar at the very top of this page, and can also be modified there if you want to change where this notebook lives.


!!! warning "Diving deeper"
	Periodically throughout the notebook we will include collapsible sections like the one below to provide additional information about items outside the scope of this lab that may be of interest (e.g., plotting, working with javascript, creating widgets).

## Background 📖

It turns out that the alien world described in the [3 Body Problem](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/3-body-problem-teaser-release-date) is not too far off from what we see in reality. Star systems can be made up of just one star like in our system, three as in the tv show and book series from which the 3 Body Problem [draws its inspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri), or even as many as six different stars as in this [recently discovered system](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/exoplanets/discovery-alert-first-six-star-system-where-all-six-stars-undergo-eclipses/)! While these would make for some quite interesting sunsets, a system's stability decreases as more bodies are added. This is partly why the most common star systems we see are singular star systems, followed closely behind by binary systems, which have two stars and account for [nearly two-thirds of all star systems in the Milky Way](https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/news/most-milky-way-stars-are-single).

A sub-class of this binary star case, known as eclipsing binaries, has proved to be an invaluable tool for helping us learn more about [orbital mechanics and stellar evolution](https://www.aavso.org/introduction-why-are-eclipsing-binary-stars-important). In these types of systems, not only do these two stars orbit about their common center-of-mass, but they do so along our line of sight. In other words, eclipsing binaries are star systems where each star passes in front of the other from our vantage point. As they do so, the combined light that we receive from both objects will vary in time.

*ESO/L. Calçada*

In this visualization, we see how the observed brightness of an eclipsing binary system changes based on how much of each star is visible at a given point in time from our perspective. When they are both unobstructed the measured brightness is maximum, and when one is partially covered by the other, the combined brightness decreases periodically over time. In this lab, we will capture this dance going on in real time in a fairly popular constellation.

## Introduction 🤝

[W Ursae Majoris (W UMa)](https://www.aavso.org/vsots_wuma) is an eclipsing binary system located in the [Ursa Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major) constellation, and can be seen being chased across the sky by the Big Dipper throughout the night:

Discovered in the early 1900s, this system is composed of two main-sequence F-type stars orbiting so closely together that they are expected to be [contact binaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_binary), meaning they share a common gaseous envelope. Their proximity to each other also gives this system an astonishingly short orbital period of just over 8 hours. Because of how neatly this fits into an Earth day, eclipse events occur at almost the same time every night, making them the ideal target for regular follow-up study. When the fainter of the two passes in front of the brighter one, we call that a _primary eclipse_, and when the brighter companion passes in front of the fainter one, we call it a _secondary eclipse_.

According to the [AAVSO ephemeris](https://www.aavso.org/sites/default/files/AAVSO_%20EB_Ephemeris_%202024.pdf) for this system, primary and secondary eclipses are predicted to occur around **3:00 and 7:00 UTC**, respectively. Due to the similar sizes and spectral types of each star, the eclipse depths for both are fairly similar and can vary by almost a whole apparent magnitude! With a total duration of about three hours, the entire light curve for a given eclipse can be captured in a single night.

### A note on image calibration

A critical step in analyzing astronomical data is accounting for sources of noise that may impact our final image. This process is known as calibration, and its purpose is to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of our science images. Here is a nice summary modified from [Practical Astrophotography](https://practicalastrophotography.com/a-brief-guide-to-calibration-frames/) of three of the main sources of noise that we typically try to calibrate for:

!!! note ""
	**Bias frames:** "Your camera inherently has a base level of read-out noise as it reads the values of each pixel of the sensor, called bias. When averaged out, basically it’s an inherent gradient to the sensor. Bias Frames are meant to capture this so it can be removed."

	**Dark frames:** "When taking a long exposure, the chip will introduce "thermal" noise. Its level is magnified by three things – temperature, exposure time, and ISO. Dark frames are used to subtract this sensor noise from your image and mitigate "hot or cold" pixels. (Some modern sensors automatically calculate dark levels and don't need dark frames). Dark Frames also will calibrate the chip so all pixels give the same value when not exposed to light."

	**Flat frames:** "I've seen people say flats help with light pollution. NOT TRUE AT ALL. Flat frames allow you to calculate the correction factor for each pixel so they all give the same value when exposed to the same quantity of light for a given optical path. Things like dust motes, lens vignetting consistently reduce the light to a given pixel, flat frames allow you to mathematically remove them to give a smooth evenly illuminated image."
"""

# ╔═╡ 2b32512b-63df-4a48-8e72-bf20aa75a845
md"""
Different flat fielding techniques are being examined by our team, but in general this has not been oberserved to be a significant source of noise in science mode observations. In practice, the [sensor calibration](https://help.unistellar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011333600-Sensor-calibration-Dark-Frame-How-and-Why) step that is required at the end of science observations are set to the same gain and exposure time as your science images. By doing this, the bias frame is automatically built into the dark frames collected during this step, so no separate bias acquisition is needed.

We find that the contribution from dark noise does not impact our observations significantly, so we have excluded this calibration step for simplicity. Stay tuned for a future calibration notebook though where we will explore these procedures in more detail!

## Image alignment 📐

A typical astronomical observation might use the know RA and Dec of the field to [plate solve](https://astrobackyard.com/plate-solving/) each frame against background sources (see, e.g., [astrometry.net](https://astrometry.net/)). This then gives a coordinate transformation (e.g., with the [World Coordinate System (WCS) standard](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_wcs.html)) that can be applied to each frame to align them to a common grid with open source tools like [AstroImageJ](https://www.astro.louisville.edu/software/astroimagej/). Unfortunately, plate solving is a computationally expensive process that can take quite a while, especially if we have a large number of frames. Fortunately, there is a nice alternative that we can use if we do not care about the WCS information: [asterisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_(astronomy)).

In this process, one frame is aligned to another in much the same way that a human brain might try to: by matching common shapes between each frame to each other. This works indpendently of WCS information, so it completely avoids the need to plate solve our images. We will employ the Python package [`astroalign`](https://astroalign.quatrope.org/en/latest/index.html) to perform this process.

### Wrapping up

We now have a light curve of an eclipsing binary captured at the predicted time! By eye, totality looks to have lasted for about half an hour, and the total eclipse duration looks to be close to the three hours estimated by the ephemeris. Not too bad for a quick observation taken from a backyard in the middle of a light polluted city.

Since the total period for this system is about 8 hours, we only caught one of the eclipses, in this case the secondary eclipse. With a more careful treatment of the calibration and data reduction procedures, we might also be able to measure the eclipse depth as well as get a more precise estimate on the "time of minimum" (ToM). The former allows us to determine the size of the eclipsing object relative to its companion, and the latter is the precise time that the two objects are exactly aligned. Measuring the ToM over time create so-called "[O-C curves](https://www.aavso.org/analysis-times-minima-o-c-diagram)", or observed minus calculated (predicted) times over time, which allow us to not only measure the periods of binary systems, but also characterize the stellar and orbital evolution of these dynamic systems.

	1. Large change in brightness (at least half a mag)
	2. Fairly short period (period < 3 days)
	3. Includes an ephemeris (the `other_info` column must include this link)

	!!! note
		We also prioritize dimmer targets (V > 9.0). The reason for this is that we are taking a timeseries over the course of hours, which would lead to an unfeasable number of total science frames taken if the exposure time for each one needed to be dialed down for bright targets. Instead, we fix our exposure time to the maximum on eVscopes (4 seconds), and select targets that would not be overexposed at this level.
	
	Lastly, we select the columns that we care about and make some visual transforms for convenience (e.g., including units, converting decimal RA and Dec to `[h m s]`, and `[° ' "]` format, respectively, for easy copy-pasting into the Unistellar app):
